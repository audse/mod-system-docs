  "description": "The ModAsset class extends the Resource class in the Godot game engine. It represents an asset associated with a Mod, containing a unique identifier (key) and a reference to a loaded resource (asset). The ModAsset is loaded once per associated Mod, ensuring that all instances of the mod share the same resource. This approach simplifies asset management by allowing developers to reference assets by their key rather than worrying about individual loading or file paths.",
